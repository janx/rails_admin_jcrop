# RailsAdmin Jcrop Plugin

## Image cropping made easy! ##

1. Add it to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'rails_admin'
# Because rails_admin_jcrop autoload modules by checking plugins you use, it's
# recommended to require it explictly before rails_admin_jcrop

# choose your file_upload gem
# gem 'carrierwave', :require => 'carrierwave'
# or
# gem "paperclip", :git => "git://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip.git"

gem 'rails_admin_jcrop' #, git: 'git://github.com/janx/rails_admin_jcrop.git'
```

2. Configure your model field to use Jcrop:

```ruby
# RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/rails_admin.rb
config.model User do
  configure :avatar, :jcrop

  # Below is optional
  edit do
    field :avatar do
      jcrop_options aspectRatio: 500.0/320.0
    end
  end
end
```

3. If you use Paperclip, you need to do nothing here, rails_admin_jcrop will append RailsAdminJcropper processor to your attachment automatically. If CarrierWave is used, please invoke  :rails_admin_crop in your uploader:

```ruby
class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base

  version :thumb do
    process :rails_admin_crop
    process resize_to_fill: [500,320]
  end

end
```

4. Done! Click the image on your RailsAdmin model edit page and enjoy cropping!

### Tips ###

* Crop is done when you successfully return from the modal box, you don't need to save the whole record.
* If you don't see the cropped image on rails admin edit page, the browser is possibly displaying cached version. Try refresh your browser.
* `rails_admin_jcrop >= 1.0.0` works with `rails_admin ~> 0.3.x`. For older rails_admin, use rails_admin_jcrop 0.2.1.

## Field Options ##

### jcrop_options ###

You can pass any Jcrop plugin allowed options here, for example, use `aspectRatio` to fix the ratio of selection box:

```ruby
field :avatar do
  jcrop_options aspectRatio: 500.0/320.0
end
```

Please check [Jcrop document](http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Manual.html#Setting_Options) for more available options.

### fit_image ###

By default, image is scaled properly to make cropping more easy, but sometimes the image is still too large to fit in the modal window, you may need to scroll image up/down to crop. If you set `fit_image` to true, image will always be resized to fit in modal window.

```ruby
field :avatar do
  fit_image true
end
```

Check screenshots below to see the difference:

When `fit_image` is false (default)

When `fit_image` is true

![fit_image true](https://github.com/janx/rails_admin_jcrop/raw/master/screenshots/fit_image_true.png)

## Localization ##

Localize the crop form by adding these entries:

        zh:
          admin:
            actions:
              crop:
                title: '剪裁'
                menu: '剪裁'
